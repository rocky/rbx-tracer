This code builds off of code from the Rubinius reference debugger. At
the time it was created, Brian Ford and Evan Phoenix were the primary
forces behind that. See the AUTHORS file in the Rubinius distribution
for a complete list of Rubinius authors.

I am very grateful to Evan for so graciously and willing making
numerous little changes that I tink not only improve the debugging
experience, but increase location reporting and live introspection.
