Simulate Ruby 1.8, 1.9, JRuby's _set_trace_func_ and CRIPT_LINES__ in Rubinius.

What is method __Kernel#set_trace_func__ and constant SCRIPT_LINES___ ? 

__set_trace_func(proc)__ establishes *proc* as the handler for tracing or disables tracing if the parameter is *nil*. 

if constaint __SCRIPT_LINES____ is defined and references a Hash, Ruby will store an entry containing the contents of each Ruby file it loads. The  key for each hash entry is the file loaded as given by ____FILE____ and the value is an Array of Strings with newlines containing the file contents.

Example of __set_trace_func__ :

bc.    require 'rubygems'; require 'set_trace'
    meth = lambda { |event, file, line, id, binding, classname|
      puts "tracer: #{event} #{file}:#{line}"
    }
    set_trace_func meth


Example of SCRIPT_LINES__ :

bc.    require 'rubygems'; require 'script_lines'
    SCRIPT_LINES__ = {}
    load 'foo.rb'
    # SCRIPT_LINES__ should have 'foo.rb' as a key and file contents as an Array
    # if it the 'foo.rb' loaded successfully.
