Simulate Ruby 1.8, 1.9, JRuby's set_trace_func and SCRIPT_LINES__ in Rubinius.

What is Kernel#set_trace_func and constat SCRIPT_LINES__ ? 

set_trace_func(proc):

Establishes proc as the handler for tracing or disables tracing if the parameter is nil. 

SCRIPT_LINES__: 

If constant SCRIPT_LINES__ is defined and references a Hash, Ruby will store an entry containing the contents of each Ruby file it loads. The 
key for each hash entry is the file loaded as given by __FILE__ and the value is an Array of Strings with newlines containing the file contents.

Example of set_trace_func

bc. 
    require 'rubygems'; require 'set_trace'
    meth = lambda { |event, file, line, id, binding, classname|
      puts "tracer: #{event} #{file}:#{line}"
    }
    set_trace_func meth

Example of SCRIPT_LINES__

bc. 
    require 'rubygems'; require 'script_lines'
    SCRIPT_LINES__ = {}
    load 'foo.rb'
    # SCRIPT_LINES__ should have 'foo.rb' as a key and file contents as an Array
    # if it the 'foo.rb' loaded successfully.
