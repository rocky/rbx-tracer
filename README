Simulate Ruby 1.8, 1.9, JRuby's set_trace_func in Rubinius.

We also add back support for storing source text in SCRIPT__ which this
constant is a hash.

Example of set_trace_func

    require 'rubygems'; require 'set_trace'
    meth = lambda { |event, file, line, id, binding, classname|
      puts "tracer: #{event} #{file}:#{line}"
    }
    set_trace_func meth

Example of SCRIPT_LINES__

    require 'rubygems'; require 'script_lines'
    SCRIPT_LINES = {}
    load 'foo.rb'
    # SCRIPT_LINES should have 'foo.rb' as a key and file contents as an Array
    # if it was loaded successfully.
